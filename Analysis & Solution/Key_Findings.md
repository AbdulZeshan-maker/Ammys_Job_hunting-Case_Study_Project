**Key Finding's from the case study**

1) Disparity Between Total and Average Salaries Across Departments: The company incurs the highest total annual salary expenditure in the IT department and the lowest in the Accounting department. However, the average salary in the IT department ranks third from the bottom, while the Accounting department has the highest average salary among all departments.

   Conclusion: This indicates that the IT department likely has a larger number of employees receiving relatively lower individual salaries, whereas     the Accounting department has fewer employees with higher individual salaries.

   Recommendation: It is recommended to further analyze the headcount and role distribution in both departments. The company should assess whether       the compensation structures align with the responsibilities, skill levels, and market standards for each role. In the case of IT, the lower       average salary could affect talent retention and productivity if not aligned with industry benchmarks. For Accounting, the high average salary may    indicate overcompensation or a top-heavy team structure that might need optimization.

2) The company spends very less on sum of annual salary of Network Engineer compared to other job titles. Here we are not talking about average    salary. Because the average salary will not tell you about the company spendings on particular job title, it will just compare the pay of a job    title with other job title. When the average was chosen in the values which you can choose by clicking the value field setting, it was found that    IT Coordinator job title has the least average salary.

3) Descriptive Analysis of Employee Age:

   Central Tendency:
   Mean Age: 44.38
   Median Age: 45
   Mode: 45 
   
   The mean, median, and mode are all close to each other, indicating a symmetrical distribution of ages with no significant outliers pulling the    average.

   Spread of Data:
   Standard Deviation: 11.25
   Range: 40 (from 25 to 65 years)
   Variance: 126.49

   This suggests a moderate spread of ages, with employees distributed fairly evenly across a 40-year span. The standard deviation shows there’s    decent diversity in the workforce age.

   Shape of Distribution:
   Skewness: 0.023 (Very close to 0 → distribution is almost symmetrical)
   Kurtosis: -1.08 (Negative kurtosis (platykurtic) → flatter distribution, fewer extreme age values compared to a normal distribution.)

   Count:
   Total Employees: 1000
   Age Range: 25 to 65

   The workforce is entirely within a working-age population, with a fairly even mix of younger and older employees.

   No Major Skew or Outliers: No evidence of a dominant younger or older population — useful for succession planning, workforce development, and       diversity initiatives.

   Planning Opportunities:
   Given the upper age of 65, retirement planning and knowledge transfer programs might be timely for older segments.

   Recommendations:
   Succession Planning: Start identifying critical roles held by older employees nearing retirement.
